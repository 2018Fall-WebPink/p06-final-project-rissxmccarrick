        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p2>Eva Kor is a survivor of the Nazi Holocaust and the <a href="http://www.auschwitz.dk/mengele.htm">"Angle of Death"</a>. Eva writes in her book about how her and her twin sister survived the "Angel of Death" when they were only ten years old. Eva and her twin sister Miriam were sent to a concentration camp in Auschwitz to be experimented on by an insane man named Dr. Mengele. Eva is an inspirational woman who has inspired others around the world to never give up. Throughout her time in the concentration camp she fought to keep her and her sister alive through the hardships of starvation and sickness. Eva's book; <i>Surviving the Angel of Death</i>, has affected tons of young adults by educating them not only on Evaâ€™s story of surviving genocide but also learning how to forgive.</p2>
        
        <br />
        
        <p3>After Eva and her sister were liberated from the concentration camp they eventually imigrated to the United States. Eva met her future husband, Michael, who was also a Holocaust survivor.
